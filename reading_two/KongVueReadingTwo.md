In summary the reading showcase a conversation between Douglas Coupland and Daniel Brinbrum about art and virtual reality. They go into a lot of topics, some of them are: how virtual reality is better than reality itself, some limits of virtual reality, why artists are producing art in virtual reality, and possible affects that virtual reality can have on the internet. The reading was insightful to how other’s view virtual reality.

I do not have a lot of experiences with virtual reality so I feel like it’s not my place to say anything but from my previous encounter with virtual reality I do know that its sill a long way from perfectly mirroring reality. In the reading there as a section that reminds me of the previous reading; we can touch, see, and hear within VR but for our other sense we probably have to wait 30-50 more years because the science for it does not exist. I was reminded of the headset from Pygmalion’s Spectacles and how it uses all sense to fully immerse the main character into the story. I will be more impress with VR when this happen. In my experience with VR, no matter how immersive the material is, I still always have that part of me that knows that what I am seeing is not real. How do we determine if something is real? 

The reading also mentioned other artists working with VR: Paul McCarthy,
Alejandro González Iñárritu, Jeff Koons, and Marina Abramović. I thought it was interesting when Douglas and Daniel started talking about how museums would sell this kind of art. The minimum requirement to enter a VR environment is a VR headset/goggles and a powerful machine or strong internet connection. Normal people can barely afford the equipment. It brings up an interesting question of how we will view art in the future.
