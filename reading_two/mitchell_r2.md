### ART 175 - Reading 2

VR is both an emerging form of technology and art. There's a ton of science behind it. Although some people can get motion sickness by entering the virtual environment, but others may find themselves not wanting to return the real worldâ€”which had been my case during my experience with VR. I found my self totally immersed, so much that the virtual world was a much more interesting place that I wanted to keep exploring.

There are also a ton of people trying to conceptualize ideas into the virtual world. Like how the Internet initially had simple pages, VR in its current stage does not live up to what it has to offer. Artists are trying to extend the realms and explore the possibilities of VR. The computer, at first, was used to send and receive messages from other servers far away. Now we have software on these computers that can draw works in both 2D and 3D space, despite the work can only be displayed on a 2D surface. This makes me wonder what the potential of VR has since we are able to enter the 3D world. I personally think we may start to see content creation software like Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, and Maya be renovated and updated for VR environments.

The interview in the reading was very interesting, as the interviewee's opinions were from a new and humorous perspective. What we will start to see and experience in future VR content, I believe, is more of people's way of expressing personal experiences. Whether it be horrific or traumatic, tragic or comical, simple or complex, one's encounters and stories could best be experienced by another through virtual reality.
