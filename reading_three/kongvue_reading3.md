# VR, why so conceptual. #

The reading was not very interesting, personally, but it does provide good exposure to thinking conceptually when creating artworks in VR. I point this out because I know that a lot of students, including me, in the DMA program struggles with this. If I understand the reading correctly it seems that Rachel Rossin’s paintings, the one showcased in the article, are recreations of digital originals. I like the way this process connects back to the tittle “Lossy” which is relating to data compression in which unnecessary information is discarded. The thought of information lost during the transfer from a digital screen to an oil canvas grabbed my attention. 

I also found the quote below to be quite interesting but I am not sure if I fully agree with it: 

“Despite its immersiveness, the virtual reality installation requires a suspension of disbelief; this is what enables art to comment on experience, rather than being an enveloping experience unto itself.” 

I guess I can understand that quote in the context where old and new medias are combined. After a few minutes of thinking, I guess VR does require a sense of disbelief and this happens in the initial stages of putting on the headset. While being in a VR scene there is always that link back to reality that reminds us that whatever we are seeing is not real. For a brief time, we might forget or even want to stay in the scene longer, but we know it’s not real.
