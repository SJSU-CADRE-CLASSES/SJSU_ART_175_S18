In this article, “ Understanding Virtual Reality and its applications beyond Gaming,” written by Mai Luong, Luong talks about the 
different areas of uses Virtual Reality has other than what we’re used to seeing, gaming. Luong starts off by introducing what VR is and 
its key concept:immersion, sensory feedback and interactivity. Other uses of VR that she mentions are live events, simulation,exploration, 
and social platforms and virtual collaboration. These concepts she had mentioned so far are what I am familiar with already but the one 
that stood out to me the most was empathy. I had no prior knowledge with “empathy” in VR nor would ever think that this concept would be 
immersed in it. VR can affect people on an emotional level than any other media because its immersive experience. Luong brings up an 
example of empathy in VR; a VR film called Clouds Over Sidra. Its a VR film made to raise awareness of Syrian refugee’s struggles and 
bring viewers into an experience of joining a group of refugee children in a day of the life in the Za’atari camp in Jordan. As a 
videographer and aspiring filmmaker, I am surprised to see film making in VR. I shouldnt be surprised but its a pleasant discovery. Film’s 
itself are able to tell a story and evoke an emotional response but with VR, it will strike a bigger emotional response due to its 
immersiveness. Most of the time, the main goal of a film is to trigger an emotion from the viewers.  However, VR filming will be a lot 
different from making a film from a regular camera with an operator behind the lense. Since its VR, the operator and director cannot be in 
the frame because of the 360 view camera. Also some cinematic qualities like transitions and camera movements will not be suitable in VR 
as well since it will most likely get the viewer sick. Cons aside, I have lots of ideas and curiosity with Film and VR. Hopefully I can 
figure a way out to incorporate my own video work with VR in this class.
