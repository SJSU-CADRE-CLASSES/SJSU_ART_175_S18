### ART 175 - Reading 3

As one of the newest forms of emerging technologies in the 21st century, VR has received much insight from both engineers and artists. VR has potential to become an integral part to human lives and how humans interact with technology. Developers have already released games and applications that use the VR headset that immerse users into new and/or entirely different worlds within virtual space. However, we have yet to see any 'killer' app that makes VR, so to speak, the next iPhone and the App Store. If a killer use of VR were to come, I believe it would be in the future (could be near future) but once when more of our senses get integrated into the hardware. Currently, VR includes 3-dimensional sight, hearing, and can detect our movement throughout the virtual space. On the other hand, I also believe there may not be a 'killer' application, but instead an accumulation of the rest of the VR apps that become the VR experience.

After reading the article, I found myself even more interested in the aspect of 'exploration' using VR. The first time I experience Google Earth, I couldn't help myself from not wanting to leave the virtual space as I wanted to keep exploring. The world is too big to see just by walking, but VR helps to make that much easier. Another good application that I found in the article was to incorporate real life scenarios and perform training simulations in the VR space. I found similar instances of VR being used as training purposes for athletes in another article, in which I thought was quite practical. The closest we could probably get to playing sports or doing physical activities in real life is to simulate in virtual spaces.
