“Tripping Through Digital Landscapes in Virtual Reality and on Canvas,” is an article that touches on the work of Rachel Rossin and her 
show, Lossy. The term “Lossy,” stood out to me because I am fimiliar with “lossless video,” when exporting/compressing video from Adobe 
Premiere Pro. The term is a word used to describe .mp4, .mp3 and .jpgs files that have had been compressesed and had their bits and bytes 
sacrificed to save space. The upside of this type of compression is smaller file sizes but you lose quality. Interested in seeing how she 
achieved made her pieces in VR and canvas, I researched further. She used a photogrametty software to capture a 3-D scan of her private 
spaces like her bedroom and uses Unity to alter the them by using “forces of physics to certain parts of the scene.” Then, she creates an 
oil painting rendition of the virtual scene. I think its really cool that she used the same software we use in class to make this project. 
It shows me so much more what Unity can do. What I took out of her project is; when we think about what the virtual world is, our idea 
actually translated into something different. We think about a certain idea but we also lose some details (lossy). As for the real 
physical world, the same applies.  Our concepts and thoughts are always translated into something different and lose some details about it 
(lossy.)
