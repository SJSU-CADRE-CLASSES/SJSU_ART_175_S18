In the article, “Tripping Through Digital Landscapes in Virtual Reality and on Canvas,” Jeffrey Grunthaner discusses the works of Rachel Rossin and her show “Lossy.” “Lossy” is a term described as relating to the compression of data and the unneeded information of that information is thrown away. In the show, Rossin creates worlds created from these compressed data and places them into a virtual reality space. These virtual worlds are also translated in the form of oil pianted canvases. The article states that for lossy “immaterial images are rendered as plausible realities.” Therefore, the forms inside of the data are turned into visual forms and given a new viewing experience within the gallery. The article states that lossy means to lose visual detail, however from what the canvas looks like in virtual reality seems to be quite the opposite. When translating a visualization from one medium to the next, it creates a whole different look to the same thing. In this case, the virtual reality scenes become unique and visually beautiful but as does it’s physical counterpart for different reasons. This idea is the same for many other art pieces that were placed in different mediums, especially in the 1900s where video instead of traditional mediums was becoming very prominent. In today’s world of 3D, VR has become yet another tool to portray creativity, new experiences, and to go beyond what is expected.
