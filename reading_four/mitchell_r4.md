### ART 175 - Reading 4

The article is about _Lossy_, an appropriately titled painting and VR installation by Rachel Rossin juxtapositioning allusions of lossy images and the digital worlds of virtual reality environments. The viewer is immersed into headsets that projects the scenes of games and digital media, then goes to view the paintings that represent those worlds but through lossy depictions. As with lossy image compression on computers, informations is lossed or distorted in many cases. However, I believe, as with Rossin's installation, losing information could mean adding a ton more. Seeing information only gives us fact, but when something is missing or out of context our brains can and will try to fill those missing features, hence stimulating out creative processes. Rossin's paintings are interesting not only because of their uniqueness and other-worldliness, but also because of its lossinessâ€”its lack of an attempt to become the original. Without the VR, albeit, this collective art piece would not be as strong; the immersive virtual worlds helps to put back the missing keys, which also helps in invoking conversation with the physical pieces.
