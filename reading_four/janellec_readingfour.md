The article reviews <i>Lossy</i>, a mixed media exhibition by Rachel Rossin drawing data from its physical artwork to create a virtual realm in which the data forms its visual forms. The word "lossy" is a term that describes the diminishing details of an image as it goes through data compression. A certain phenomenon surrounding the lossy image some time during the internet cultures evolution. Rather than lossy images "losing" details, it is also seen as a technique for the creation of something different from the original source image; whether this practice and study came into being out of pure curiosity, an exploration of digital art, or out of the simple need for memes, it is fascinating to see this concept act as the focus of a fine arts exhibition itself. In fact, part of the magnificence of Rossin's environments is due to her embracing of loss; the VR piece is no longer an image/representation of the painting, but something new and independent of its originator. It is something made some parts programming and some parts human mind, and molded by the technology that builds and limits it.The resulting virtual realm, and its juxtapositioning of it wih the physical paintings, is a beautiful, poetic tribute to the relationship between physical media and its virtual counterparts.
