### ART 175 - Assignment 1

I find it amazing that, despite being written over 100 years ago, the concept in the narrative can still hold today and can spike conversations that heavily relate to the world that is not the real one—the reality as we know it.

At first impression, the narrative reminded me of Elon Musk's vision that we may possibly be living in a simulated world created by a supercomputer. The world we think we live in is all a simulation—everything we see, do, and think is all pre-programmed by this supercomputer created by future beings (possibly not even human). The scary things is that although we may be aware that everything is simulated, there is nothing we can do about it.

With the rate at which technology is advancing, I believe it is safe to assume we are on the trajectory of achieving photorealistic VR with the common devices we used today (i.e. smartphones and PCs). If people playing VR today are already having trouble trying to decipher between the real and the virtual world after playing for certain amounts of time, we could probably completely find ourselves lost and unreturnable in future VR systems and environments. The current state of VR utilizes vision and audio to submerse users into the virtual worlds. If the rest of our senses (touch, smell, and taste) as well as movement become utilized, we may find ourselves even more deep into the new reality and further away from the actual reality. Tricking the human mind is quite easy and with the advancements of VR, for better or for worse, who knows where it could take us. I luckily don't get sick from being in VR for long periods of time and I hope VR and AR advance even more during my time. I also believe we are so far on a good track with where we are heading with these technologies. However, we must always be cautious and not let these technologies get into the hands of the those who abuse them.
