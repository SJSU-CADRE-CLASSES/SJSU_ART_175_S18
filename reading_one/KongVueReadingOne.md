Pygmalion’s Spectacles is an amazing and interesting short story, written by Stanley Grauman Weinbaum, that presented a comprehensive and specific model for virtual reality. The story begins with a conversation between our main character, Dan Burke, and an elf-like professor, Albert Ludwig. Ludgwig had just invented a device that enabled a movie to not only give you sight but also taste, smell, and touch. Dan decided to try on Burke’s device and the story the follows Dan’s adventure into a virtual world. 

Pygmalion’s Spectacles presented some very interesting questions. One of them was, can we apply the same level of reality of an object that we see in everyday life to that in a VR experience?  I think we definitely can but it will require a few things. The first would be a device that not only give us the ability to see objects in virtual reality but also accompanies all our other senses as well. Professor Ludwig implied this in the story along with a mentioning of Bishop Berkeley who “[argued] that we do not see, feel, hear, taste the object, but that we have only the sensation of seeing, feeling, hearing, tasting." Current developers aim to achieve full immersion in virtual reality through photorealistic graphics. I believe they need to pay more attention to the role sensation plays in the user’s immersion. We experience our world through sensations. One can tell ones dreaming when he or she slaps his or herself and feels no pain. I personally experience this many times and it totally kicks me out of the dream. If we were to treat a dream like a kind of virtual reality, then I would say the same rules apply. 
 
I am really intrigued by this tale of virtual reality. As I kept listening to the audio book, I grew more and more attached to the story. I myself had dreams that that kept me from ever waking up. I have had intimate relationships with others who simply vanish literally from a blink of an eye and it hurts. I can relate to the main character as towards the end he wanted to stay but can’t. The difference here is that he remembered everything that happened. When we wake up from a dream, we forget a lot of it. This is both a blessing and a curse.
