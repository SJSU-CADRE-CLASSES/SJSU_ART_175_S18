For a tale with a vintage from the heydays of pulp fiction, Stanley G. Weinbaum's short story 'Pygmalion's Spectacles' is spookily prescient in how similar its themes and content are to virtual reality and its position within a pop cultural zeitgest of modern times.

What is reality? Reality is what we observe, what we feel. Reality is how we experience and internalize the external world. However, as solid as reality may be there are countless ways for the perception of reality to altered. The protagonist, Dan Burke, experiences this firsthand when he dons Professor Albert Ludwig's invention which seemingly whisks Dan away to a  different and paradisical world. It seems like magic, and makes it seem like 'Pygmalion's Spectacles' is a fantasy tale, but the truth of the matter is that the world that Dan sees a cleverly constructed fever dream using Ludwig's mysterious chemicals and magnified props. Dan never left the hotel lobby, yet he was able to experience, firsthand, a story in another world. Does that sound familiar? Does that sound like a really bad trip experienced while on who-knows-how many drugs? Does that sound like a deeply lucid dream, one where the dreamer such a deep degree of control over their dreamself that the dream feels like a continutation of waking reality?

Does that sound like what happens when one puts on their Oculus Rift or Playstation VR or what-have-you and has a session of virtual reality? 

While Ludwig admits that he didn't have complete control over Dan's experience, it was still a painstakingly crafted one, and one with an outline. Those spectacles, "Pygmalion's Spectacles," according to Weinbaum's title, are like a movie, or a play, rife with interactive elements. The way that a (virtual) reality can nest inside of a waking reality and offer one an experience absolutely seems in line with the conventions of modern VR experiences. Authors like Jules Verne and series like Star Trek are found to be prescient in how they seemingly predict aspects of future technology and happenings in association with said technologies. Following my reading of 'Pygmalion's Spectacles,' I now think that Weinbaum's short story can certainly be included in that category. Even though VR devs use pixels and code instead of club moss and chemicals to bring up images and form spaces that VR users can interact with, the sentiment still holds. 

All in all, it was a sterling piece of science fiction, and I'm glad that I was able to read it.
