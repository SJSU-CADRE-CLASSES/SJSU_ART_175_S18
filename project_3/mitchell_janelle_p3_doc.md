### ART 175 - Project 3 Proposal

### [Propsal](https://goo.gl/o5YiGU)

This work-in-progress VR scene is a simulation of _beams_ of atoms traveling through a circular particle accelerator, like that of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The viewer moves along with the beams, as if they are an accelerating particle. The beams start at 0 speed and gradually accelerate through the chamber. After the third encounter with the opposite pair of atoms, the scene changes from the particle accelerator to the moment of impactâ€”when the particles collide with each other and emit large amounts of energy and information. The shattered bits and pieces of the atoms bounce into the walls of the central chamber, where the information is collected and analyzed.The tiny collision as well as this data reveal the mysteries of both quantum physics and the answers to the Big Bang.

This project will be worked on further to include the concept of the physics of traveling at light-speed. Theoretically, when an entity approaches the light of speed (or 99.9% of this universal speed limit), things start to get real weird<sup>[1](#references)</sup>. The field of view of the traveler drastically increases, to a point where you start to see things that are behind you, and everything in sight appears to be shortened in length. Time also will seem to slow down, but just for the traveler (due to Einstein's Theory of Relativity).
