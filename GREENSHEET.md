Course Description
------------------
From Data Visualization, Interactive Data Manipulation, and Data Bending, this semester’s ART 175 will be a exploration in working with data as a medium for art creation. Working with data and cross modal representation, this studio art class will be creating 3D sculptures using Maya and building real time virtual reality and augmented reality environments using Unity.

Course Goals and Student Learning Objectives
--------------------------------------------

This semester we are pleased to be presented with a special opportunity to collaborate with the School of Music in building of realtime visualizations for a final performance scheduled at the end of the semester. Using realtime sensor data as well as sound, we will be creating visuals and environments that should push the boundaries of what this bleeding edge technology is capable of. We will be working with Max/MSP, Unity and Maya for the creation of visual. Students will be asked to engage critically with class material and think creatively about the use of software as a tool for art creation.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

###### LO1: Work with realtime data and think creatively about visual representation
###### LO2: Produce professional level art
###### LO3: Gain experience in working with realtime visual environments
###### LO4: Research artist using data as a medium
###### LO5: Build your Portfolio

Grading Policy and Rubric
-------------------------

Classroom Protocol
------------------

###### There are three main individual projects for this course (in addition to smaller assignments). On workshop days (see the course outline chart for the dates), students should come to class with their in-progress projects and hard-drives ready to work. If you have your own laptop and prefer to use that for your projects, bring it to class with you for the workshop days.

###### Students must meet the deadlines for their projects. No late projects will be accepted. On Idea + concept days (see the course outline chart for the dates) students should bring notes, storyboards, sketches, charts, and material that they have used to do research on the specific topic and concept that you are interested in for their project.

Participation
-------------

###### Participation in class discussions for readings, material that we watch in class, giving feedback to your peers on their work is mandatory. Remember that 20% of your grade is based on your participation in class and you are expected to actively participate in such discourses as they are some of the most important sections of our class. Your brief written summary of your discussion comments will be due to the instructor at the end of each Presentation day and will be evaluated for demonstrated thoughtfulness and understanding of key concepts and issues.

###### Sleeping in class, texting, and looking at your Facebook or any other activity unrelated to class will also have impact on your participation grade. You are responsible for the missing material if you fall asleep in class.

###### On Presentation days you must be able to explain and give a clear presentation of your work, research, and concepts. If you have a hard time talking in front of a crowd or remembering your points, use a notebook, powerpoint, sketches or bullet points for your presentations.

###### For certain readings that I will be assigning in this course you are required to post one paragraph (400 word) response or a video with 4-5 sentences to our class blog. Those who simply summarize what they have read will not receive any points for their responses. You are asked to think critically and post something that questions, criticizes, endorses, and/or adds to the reading. I consider these small assignments as part of your class participation. See the course outline chart for deadlines for these responses.
