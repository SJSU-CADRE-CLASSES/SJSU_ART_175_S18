### ART 175 - Project 3 Proposal

Our project revolves around the idea of particle accelerators, or machines that collect quantum information by smashing atoms into each other at light speed. Upon impact, the atoms shatter and break apart into smaller bits and pieces that disperse outwards. These collisions happen millions of times in a fraction of a second, and the data and information that is released and collect helps in solving the mysteries of both quantum physics and the history of the universeâ€”tiny bangs with hopes to reveal the story of the Big Bang.

As the tiny particles approach the speed of light, the laws of physics as we know it start to bend and break. The field of view of the traveler increases to a point where you start to see things that are behind you, the traveling particle will stretch and elongate in the direction it is traveling, and time will seem to slow down drastically.

In the virtual space, viewers will travel through a circular particle accelerator (similar to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN) as if they are one atom among the others projecting as a _beam_, or bundle, of particles. The beams will circulate and collide with other beams at the other end of the particle accelerator, with each lap triggering a scene change. Upon each collision, blasts of energy will emit colorful explosions of light and data, like fireworks.
