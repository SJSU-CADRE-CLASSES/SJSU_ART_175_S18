Art 175 Project 3

Our project explores the connections of the forest, the city, and the audience through 3d constructed scenes. The concept revolves around the cycle of death and rebirth of a forest. We are interested in the idea of a forest being cleared out to make room for a city. The city eventually turns into ruins, from an unknown cause, and we get this idea of rebirth of the forest as plant life slowly grow on top of the ruins.

In total we are going to have three low poly scenes; forest, city, ruins. To emphasize this idea of death and rebirth the three scenes will be looped, starting with and ending back in the forest scene. There will be a specific path that the audience have to follow and the main scenes will transition relatively slowly. In each scene there will be objects that appear to foreshadow the next scene. An example will be a construction site within the edge of the forest. 

There are many symbolic interpretations that one can make about our project. One of them is the action of returning back to the place we first called home. Humanity originated from the forest and over time expanded across the globe to different areas. Why do people find nature scenes interesting and calming to look at? What is our connection/relationship with nature? We still cling on to our environmental past by embedding trees into our cities. Despite all the wonderful benefits that it brings into a city, trees are the revenant of our earliest interaction with nature.
